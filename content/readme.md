Yo what is good g.

Here's all you need to to know:

- I (uniornically) like to learn about AI. I think math is cool (doesn't mean I am good at it).
- I believe that becoming a professional golfer is still possible.
- Too many are LLM pilled - LeCunn
    - LLMs dominate the commercial space. IMO there are so much unexplored space for traditional ML techniques to solve boring business processes.
    - Not saying that LLMs are not powerful, I just see too many spend too much on tokens for problems that might not even need that much LLM.
- Teaching (for me) is a fulfilling activity.

Here's what I am doing now:
- Co-Founder and CTO @ Bracket AI (currently in stealth).
- Product Builder @ [Podifi AI](https://www.podifi.ai/).
- English Tutor Volunteer @ [LinguaLink](https://www.instagram.com/lingualink.idn/)
