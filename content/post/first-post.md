## Hi There

I am not the type of person who shares by nature, so this is weird ngl. At the time of writing, I am hoping to use this to document whatever I am doing at the moment. Regardless of whether this page is read by one or one thousand people, I hope to look back on this when I am older as a reminder of the journey.

My formal academic background is in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Systems from the University of Edinburgh. Alongside this, I enjoy building applications for end users. 

That work often involves talking to customers and friends and listening to their opinions on the current state of AI (Jan 2026) and how they think it can positively impact their art. I said art because I think gone are the days of simple task-doers position, or at least most of them will be sooner rather than later. Some of these conversations are truly eye-opening (which I hope to share more here) and one thing has become clear to me lately: people are taking more ownership and responsibility in their roles, and the successful ones are those who are able to think about the broader picture and adapt to increasingly powerful tools.

I started my career out of university as a co-founder for an AI company and a product builder for an agile software development firm based in the Bay Area. The combination of managing a small, highly focused team and actively being in the conversations with clients who are navigating their own set of challenges have given a broad perspective and many learning opportunities. My first lesson? Clarity and systems are the common denominator of the successful projects I have been involved with, and they are something I actively try to implement to both my personal and professional life.

This has been lengthy by my standards, so I'll end it here. Adios and maybe see you next time.
